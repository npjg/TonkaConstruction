This was one of the first computer games I ever played. If I recall correctly, I got the CD-ROM from a yard sale. This game brought much enjoyment to me as a youngster.

## Installation
Coming soon on PyPI!

## Testing
Currently there is no support for running tests from CI/CD because these services won't have the (large) game files necessary to test this library. Currently all tests are run locally with the files for each known Tonka version in the `tests/test_data` directory.
